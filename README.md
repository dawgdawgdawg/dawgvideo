# dawgvideo

Dawgvideo is a simple 1990's website built with PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

If you're planning to contribute, please note:
- You can't use Node JS
- You can't use websockets for the Sleepydog (sorry!)
- You can only use PHP and/or the other tools I provided (so it doesn't interfere with my workflow too!)

Thank you, and if you're willing to contribute, do so in pull requests or issues.
